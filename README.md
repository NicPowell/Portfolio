# Portfolio

Each branch has individual projects that I have worked on either individually or in a group.

## Different projects

1. **Maze game**:
   - My first game project created in python.
   - Simple easy to play with a video demonstrating as shown in maze game readme
   - My CS50 python end project showing lots of object oriented programming

2. **Tank game**:
   - Superseding my maze game and furthering my experience with classes and libaries.
   - Two tanks battle to finish the other 
   - When the character hits the other with the projectile they win with an immediate close.

3. **C program**:
   - Illustrates my basic understanding of C programming
   - Working in two files created a program that could detect 16 different frequencies and then regenerate using an audio file.
   - (Using the Goertzel algorithm)
